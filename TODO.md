# Bugs

# Features

- feat: when moving a file outsite the project require a confirmation
- feat: when navigating to "up" directory stop at project level

# Technical Debt

- tests: start writing unit tests
- refactor: further nest `utils` with extra files (`tbl`, `fs`, `path`, etc)
- refactor: create a module that is aware of the project and supplies the other modules with relevant functionality
